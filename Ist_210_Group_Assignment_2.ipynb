        "Here is our revised entity relationship diagram. The five entities are still present (**Customer, Ticket, Concert, Orchestra, and Player**), however, there were some repeating attributes that needed to be adjusted. The first repeating attribute was TicketID, an attribute of **Customer**. However, since a customer can buy multiple tickets, it was a repeating attribute, so we resolved this issue by creating a new entity, **TicketData**. Another repeating attribute was PlayerID, originally an attribute of **Orchestra** (an orchestra has multiple players). We created a new entity, **PlayerData** to resolve this issue. Now onto the cardinalities: A customer can buy 1 to 100 tickets in a year, and a ticket is associated one and only one customer. A specific ticket (described by ticket ID) is associated with one and only one ticket. A ticket is what allows a customer to access the concert, and one specific ticket is associated with one and only one concert. However, a concert has up to 300 available openings. Each specific concert is performed by one and only one orchestra, and an orchestra can perform 1 to 50 concerts in a given year. In an orchestra, there can be 1 to 100 players, and each player is associated with one and only one player ID. Specific attributes were not adjusted from the original diagram, but a slight adjustment was made regarding how the entities are connected. In the original diagram, the customer and concert entities were connected (A customer sees a concert), but we revised that relationship in our diagram to instead connect a customer to a concert through their ticket instead. This is because it's more logical for a ticket to be connected to a specific concert than a customer connected to a specific concert. "
